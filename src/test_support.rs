//! Encoder-side mirrors of this crate's decoders ([`BoolEncoder`] for
//! [`crate::bool_coder::BoolDecoder`], [`BitWriter`] for the raw bit-level uncompressed-header
//! reader), used to hand-build synthetic bitstreams for round-trip tests.
//!
//! Used directly by unit tests inside `src/` (via `#[cfg(test)]`), and by integration tests
//! under `tests/` via the `test-support` feature, which this crate's own dev-dependency on
//! itself enables. Never compiled into a normal release build.

/// A bool encoder for tests only.
///
/// This is an arithmetic encoder performing the inverse operation of
/// [`crate::bool_coder::BoolDecoder`], implemented solely for round-trip tests.
///
/// Implementation approach: because this coder has the structure "the
/// range (BoolRange) is capped at 255 and renormalized by doubling one
/// bit at a time whenever it drops below 128", the encoder side has the
/// classic arithmetic-coding problem where a carry into not-yet-finalized
/// low bits can retroactively affect bits already emitted.
///
/// This implementation does not stream; instead it receives the entire
/// sequence of bools to encode and emits the output all at once, holding
/// the internal state `low` as an "arbitrary-precision binary number" so
/// that carry propagation is handled as exact bignum arithmetic (no
/// approximation or special carry-detection logic needed).

    /// renormalization). The first 8 bits are initialized to 0 as a
    /// placeholder for the first byte, where BoolValue is stored.
